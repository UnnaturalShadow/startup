        <h1>Welcome to RaidBuddy</h1>
        <p>RaidBuddy provides guidance for Destiny 2 raids in the form of guides, images, and collaborative, interactive maps.
            This project is made possible with much thanks to <a href="https://youtube.com/@soteriaaugur?si=tgIqXwQuYepCH4_5" target="_blank">SoteriaAugur</a> who
            created the maps and provided the vast majority of the written content for the guides as well. 
        </p>
