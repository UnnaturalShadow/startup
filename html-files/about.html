        <h1>Welcome to FlushCode</h1>
        <p>FlusChode provides codes to keypads on public restroom doors so that you can save yourself the trouble of bothering an employee for the code!
            This project is possible thanks to the contributions of users like you who help to grow and update our database of bathroom codes. If you'd 
            like to contribute to the project simply make an account and you can start adding your own codes to the collection!
        </p>
        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            Please note that codes obtained through FlushCode are only to be used in accordance with the restroom owners restroom policy (i.e. for paying 
            customers only, free and open to the public, only for Jedi Masters, etc.). Uploading codes to any door or lock that is not a publically accessible
            restroom is strictly prohibited and anyone who does so may have their account revoked. If you come across a code that does not belong to a
            public restroom, or are a business owner who wishes to have their restroom code removed, please contact FlushCode admin at 
            unnaturalshadow42@gmail.com.
